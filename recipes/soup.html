    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title.
         It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I 
         generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for 
         people counting calories.)
